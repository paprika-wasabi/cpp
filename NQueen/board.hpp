// Representation of a configuration for our n-queens
// problem and iteration over all positions.
//
// Our class internally uses an array of int of a given size, where each int means:
//   - == 0 no queens in this column
//   - <0 no queen up to that position
//   - >0 the only queen is at that position.
//
// The board is already tailored toward our needs by disallowing 2 queens in
// this column. We also are using a fixed size.
//
// For each board, there are at most two successors: either the queen is at the next empty position
// (the column value was <= 0 and has now value > 0) or it is not (the column value was <=0 and is
// now decreased by 1).
